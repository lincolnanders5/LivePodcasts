# RSS-Create
A simple Node.js program to create a podcast feed for a folder of audio files.
The program generates an RSS feed to be added inside Apple Podcasts and allows Podcasts to download the files.

## Overview
The program can be run with `node index.js`.
A feed will be generated at the URL `http://[LOCAL IP]:4000/feed/[ENCODED PATH]`.
The program will tell you your `LOCAL IP` when run.
The `ENCODED PATH` part is an absolute path to a directory on your computer, URL encoded.
A URL encoder can be found [here](http://urlencoder.org).

Once you have your feed URL generated by the encoder, you can paste that into Apple Podcasts.
The program will output text when a feed is accessed and when a file is downloaded.
After the URL is in Podcasts, files inside the directed folder will be avaliable as episodes inside the 

## Formatting
The name of the podcast will be the name of the folder pointed to in the encoded URL.
The name of each episode will be the name of that file, without file types (like .mp3, .m4b, etc.)

## Notes
- This program was thrown together with no error handling or security measures.
***Any file on your computer can be downloaded if this program is left running; this is a huge security hole.***
This is not planned to be fixed as this is a simple solution and not meant to be left running for long spans of time.
- This repo will likely not be updated by me much in the future.
This was a project thrown together to let me download an audiobook into a podcast player.
That worked, and the tool has done its job.
- This program works in Apple Podcasts. 
It does not work in [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) due to how [Overcast handles downloads](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/podcats/issues/8).
- Feeds will only refresh and files will only download when the program is running.
